    "# QUES.1 What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "# ANSWER Lasso Regression, short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a type of linear regression that \n",
    "# incorporates regularization to prevent overfitting and encourage sparsity in the coefficient values. In simple terms, it \n",
    "# adds a penalty term to the traditional least squares objective function, which penalizes the absolute size of the \n",
    "# coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's how Lasso Regression differs from other regression techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.Regularization: Unlike ordinary least squares regression, which minimizes the sum of squared residuals, Lasso Regression \n",
    "# adds a penalty term to the objective function, which penalizes the absolute size of the coefficients. This penalty term \n",
    "# helps prevent overfitting by shrinking the coefficients towards zero.\n",
    "# 2.Sparsity: One of the key features of Lasso Regression is that it can yield sparse solutions, meaning it can set some of \n",
    "# the coefficients to exactly zero. This property makes Lasso Regression useful for feature selection, as it can automatically\n",
    "# select the most important features by setting the coefficients of less important features to zero.\n",
    "# 3.Variable Selection: Traditional regression techniques may struggle with datasets containing a large number of features, as\n",
    "# they can lead to overfitting. Lasso Regression, with its ability to set coefficients to zero, can effectively perform \n",
    "# variable selection by identifying and excluding irrelevant features from the model.\n",
    "# 4.Geometric Interpretation: Lasso Regression introduces a constraint on the magnitude of the coefficients, which can be\n",
